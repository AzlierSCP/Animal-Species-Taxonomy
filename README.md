# Animal-Species-Taxonomy
The goal of this project is to display taxonomy information for over 900 animal species. The taxonomy levels that will display will be the Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species and Scientific Name. These taxonomy groups are a way of describing the evolutionary similarities between different animal species
